OttoPlus with arms - code for mBlock.

#A OttoPlus/arms Extension for mBlock software
This comes under OttoDIY/Plus advance Ottobot, coding with mBlock like Scratch blocks to program their Ottos with arms.

Mblock is a software that allows Programming in Scratch Language for robots,Release by Makeblock, inherited from Scratch 2.0 by MIT. Extension is a set of files that allows you to install blocks for different types of robots to compatible with mBlock Environment Download and install mBlock Software: http://www.mblock.cc/software/mblock/mblock3/

If this is your first time building a Otto biped robot, go to OttoDIY opensource project at http://www.ottodiy.com/ 
You can build your own and teach other people how to program Otto with Scratch like blocks in mBlock using stembotyn/OttoDIY_mBlock_extension at https://github.com/stembotvn/OttoDIY_mBlock_Extension

Respect goes to stembotyn https://github.com/stembotvn and Jason Snow https://github.com/jarsoftelectrical, whom open-source code I used to develop this mBlock Extension.

Note this is the first version and so far Blocks for servos for arms, legs and feet (otto_cpp), LED matrix (Otto_mouths) and Buzzer(Otto_sounds), work well. The Otto_Gestures blocks does not work so far will get onto this in the next version. The move blocks will produce movment in arms legs and feet. Later I'm hope to expand the blocks to include a arms only blocks for Otto to wave.
