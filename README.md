# A OttoPlus/arms Extension for mBlock software

This comes under OttoDIY/Plus advance Ottobot, coding with mBlock like Scratch blocks to program Ottos with arms.

mBlock is a software that allows programming in Scratch blocks Language for robots. Release by Makeblock, inherited from Scratch 2.0 by MIT. This Extension is a set of files that allows you to install blocks for Otto, compatible with mBlock Environment. Download and install mBlock Software first: http://www.mblock.cc/software/mblock/mblock3/

If this is your first time building a Otto biped robot, go to OttoDIY opensource project at http://www.ottodiy.com/ 
You can build your own and teach other people how to program Otto with Scratch like blocks in mBlock using stembotyn/OttoDIY_mBlock_extension at https://github.com/stembotvn/OttoDIY_mBlock_Extension

Respect goes to stembotyn https://github.com/stembotvn and Jason Snow https://github.com/jarsoftelectrical, whom open-source code I used to develop this mBlock Extension.

Note this is the first version and so far Blocks for servos for arms, legs and feet (otto_cpp), LED matrix (Otto_mouths) and Buzzer(Otto_sounds), work well. The Otto_Gestures blocks does not work so far, needs debugging and hopefully will be in the next version. The move blocks will produce movment in arms legs and feet. Later I'm hope to expand the blocks to include a arms only block for Otto to wave.
