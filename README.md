# A OttoPlus/arms Extension for mBlock software

This comes under OttoDIY/Plus advance Ottobot, coding with mBlock like Scratch blocks to program Ottos with arms.

mBlock is a software that allows programming in Scratch blocks language for robots. Release by Makeblock, inherited from Scratch 2.0 by MIT. This Extension is a set of files that allows you to install blocks for Otto, compatible with mBlock Environment. Download and install mBlock Software first: http://www.mblock.cc/software/mblock/mblock3/

If this is your first time building a Otto biped robot, go to OttoDIY opensource project at http://www.ottodiy.com or https://github.com/OttoDIY

You can build your own and teach other people how to program Otto with Scratch like blocks in mBlock using stembotyn/OttoDIY_mBlock_extension at https://github.com/stembotvn/OttoDIY_mBlock_Extension

Respect goes to stembotyn https://github.com/stembotvn and Jason Snow https://github.com/jarsoftelectrical, whom open-source code I used to develop this mBlock Extension.

Note: There are still problems with the Javascript in JS folder and this crucial code that would make the OttoPlus_arms blocks is still not working, all altered libraries for OttoPlus_arms are in the src folder. So far all libraries, for servos for arms, legs and feet (otto_cpp), LED matrix (Otto_mouths) and Buzzer(Otto_sounds) and Otto_Gestures work well, in Arduino IDE.
